minesweeper
===========

a minsweeper game i built in javascript with three built-in modes - beginner, intermediate, and expert, 
it can also be customized to the user's prefrences.
i also added a "speed-sweep" version (counts down).

i still have to remove hard-coding from "speed-sweep", making it usable for all modes (not only beginner).
